Product Manufacturer Quick Search
=================================
This module allows to make a a quick search for items using their manufacturer name or code, as well as the manufacturer name.

Usage
-----
Firstly, as a user with access to the products I find the manufacturer information section is above the note.

Then it is possible to carry out quick searches the manufacturer's product code as well as the manufacturer's product name:

In addition, if I search by the name of the manufacturer, I can find all product(s) concerned.

I also see that the place between manufacturer section and internal notes has changed.

Since the version 1.0.3, it is possible to directly search using the product name (the first suggested on search view while typing) :
- The manufacturer's name
- The manufacturer's product code
- The manufacturer's product name

This functionality is also available on product variants search.
