Product Packaging Dimension Decimal and Changeable UOM
======================================================
Add changeable UOM and allow decimal on product packaging.

Usage
-----
As an Administrator of Inventory, I go to ``Inventory > Configuration > Delivery Packages``.

.. image:: ./static/description/delivery_package_menu.png

In the form view, I can see that ``Height``, ``Width`` and ``Length`` can be in decimal value.
I also can change the unit of measure of each property to ``m`` or ``ft``.
